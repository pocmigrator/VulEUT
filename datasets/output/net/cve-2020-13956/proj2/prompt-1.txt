I want you to generate a unit test, using the JUnit testing framework, 
This test is used to verify that the vulnerability was successfully triggered,
You can't have non-existent method calls in the results you give,
Just generate a single test method,
For fuzzy parameters, give specific commonly used types, such as Object,String and so on,
Only the function under test statement is wrapped by a try catch statement(Excluding assert statement), the Exception class uses an exception, and does nothing after the catch,
The code corresponds to the function being tested, with context information, for example: 

The source code of the function under test is (The unit test should test this function):
public static void main ( String [ ] args ) { String doGet = doGet ( "http://localhost:8088//weixin/test/test.html?name=zs&age=25" ) ; System . out . println ( doGet ) ; Map < String , String > map = new HashMap < String , String > ( ) ; map . put ( "xx" , "xxx" ) ; String doGetWithParams = doGetWithParams ( "http://localhost:8088//weixin/test/test.html" , map ) ; System . out . println ( doGetWithParams ) ; String doPost = doPost ( "http://localhost:8088//weixin/test/test.html?name=zs&age=25" , "" ) ; System . out . println ( doPost ) ; String doPost2 = doPost ( "http://localhost:8088//weixin/test/test.html?name=zs&age=25" , map ) ; System . out . println ( doPost2 ) ; } 

and the class name of the function under test is:
HttpUtils

There is a method call chain from the function under test to the function called by the vulnerability code, the list of functions is:
main
doGet
Where there is a vulnerability code call function source code is (This function is used to help you understand):
public static String doGet ( String url ) { CloseableHttpClient client = null ; CloseableHttpResponse response = null ; try { client = HttpClientBuilder . create ( ) . build ( ) ; HttpGet request = new HttpGet ( url ) ; response = client . execute ( request ) ; return getResponseResult ( response ) ; } catch ( Exception e ) { logger . error ( "execute error,url: {}" , url , e ) ; } finally { IOUtils . closeQuietly ( response ) ; IOUtils . closeQuietly ( client ) ; } return "" ; } 

and the class name of this function is:
HttpUtils

The vulnerable third-party library function and the class to which the function belongs are:
class name:CloseableHttpClient
method name:execute

The input variable name for this unit test is "input", and the value of this "input" is:
http://user@apache.org:80@google.com/

the test input data is a url

After declaring test input data, you need to call the following statement:
MethodCallInterceptor.interceptor(
org.apache.http.client.methods.CloseableHttpResponse.class,"execute", new Object[]{input}
);

The assert statement to verify that the vulnerability was successfully triggered is fixed as:
assertTrue(MethodCallInterceptor.isTriggered());
assertTrue(MethodCallInterceptor.isConditionMet());
