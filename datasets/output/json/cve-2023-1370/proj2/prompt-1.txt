I want you to generate a unit test, using the JUnit testing framework, 
This test is used to verify that the vulnerability was successfully triggered,
You can't have non-existent method calls in the results you give,
Just generate a single test method,
For fuzzy parameters, give specific commonly used types, such as Object,String and so on,
Only the function under test statement is wrapped by a try catch statement(Excluding assert statement), the Exception class uses an exception, and does nothing after the catch,
The code corresponds to the function being tested, with context information, for example: 

The source code of the function under test is (The unit test should test this function):
public static JSONObject toJSONObject ( Object object ) throws ParseException , JsonProcessingException { if ( object instanceof String ) { return parseToJSONObject ( ( String ) object ) ; } String objectStr = serializeToString ( object ) ; return parseToJSONObject ( objectStr ) ; } 

and the class name of the function under test is:
MapperUtil

There is a method call chain from the function under test to the function called by the vulnerability code, the list of functions is:
toJSONObject
parseToJSONObject
Where there is a vulnerability code call function source code is (This function is used to help you understand):
private static JSONObject parseToJSONObject ( String str ) throws ParseException { JSONParser parser = new JSONParser ( DEFAULT_PERMISSIVE_MODE ) ; JSONObject json = null ; json = ( JSONObject ) parser . parse ( str ) ; return json ; } 

and the class name of this function is:
MapperUtil

The vulnerable third-party library function and the class to which the function belongs are:
class name:JSONParser
method name:parse

The input variable name for this unit test is "input", and the value of this "input" is:


Important information!! This generated test input is different from the other cases, you need to refer to the StringBuilder s of the following code as the final test input during the build process of the generated test: StringBuilder s = new StringBuilder();  for (int i = 0;  i &lt;  10000; i++) { s.append("{"a":");  } s.append("1");  for (int i = 0;  i &lt;  10000; i++) { s.append("}");  } JSONParser p = new JSONParser(JSONParser.MODE_JSON_SIMPLE);  p.parse(s.toString());

After declaring test input data, you need to call the following statement:
MethodCallInterceptor.interceptor(
net.minidev.json.parser.JSONParser.class,"parse", new Object[]{input}
);

The assert statement to verify that the vulnerability was successfully triggered is fixed as:
assertTrue(MethodCallInterceptor.isTriggered());
assertTrue(MethodCallInterceptor.isConditionMet());
