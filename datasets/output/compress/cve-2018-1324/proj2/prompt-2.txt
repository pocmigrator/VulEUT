I want you to generate a unit test, using the JUnit testing framework, 
This test is used to verify that the vulnerability was successfully triggered,
You can't have non-existent method calls in the results you give,
Just generate a single test method,
For fuzzy parameters, give specific commonly used types, such as Object,String and so on,
Only the function under test statement is wrapped by a try catch statement(Excluding assert statement), the Exception class uses an exception, and does nothing after the catch,
The code corresponds to the function being tested, with context information, for example: 

The source code of the function under test is (The unit test should test this function):
public static ZipFile createOrNull ( final String name , final String encoding ) { if ( StringUtils . isBlank ( name ) || StringUtils . isBlank ( encoding ) ) { return null ; } try { return create ( name , encoding ) ; } catch ( final Throwable t ) { LOGGER . info ( "createOrNull" , t ) ; return null ; } } 

and the class name of the function under test is:
ZipUtils

There is a method call chain from the function under test to the function called by the vulnerability code, the list of functions is:
createOrNull
create
Where there is a vulnerability code call function source code is (This function is used to help you understand):
public static ZipFile create ( final String name , final String encoding ) { try { return new ZipFile ( name , encoding ) ; } catch ( final IOException e ) { LOGGER . warn ( "create" , e ) ; throw new RuntimeException ( e ) ; } } 

and the class name of this function is:
ZipUtils

The vulnerable third-party library function and the class to which the function belongs are:
class name:ZipFile
method name:ZipFile

The input1 variable name for this unit test is "input1", and the value of this "input1" is:
CVE-2018-1324/demo/difflist_fsbwserver.f-secure.com_80_583109529_2.zip

The input2 variable name for this unit test is "input2", and the value of this "input2" is:
IdeaProjects/pocdataset/compress/CVE-2018-1324/demo/

After declaring test input data, you need to call the following statement:
MethodCallInterceptor.interceptor(
org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.zip.ZipFile.class,"ZipFile", new Object[]{input}
);

The assert statement to verify that the vulnerability was successfully triggered is fixed as:
assertTrue(MethodCallInterceptor.isTrigger);
