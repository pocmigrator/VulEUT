I want you to generate a unit test, using the JUnit testing framework, 
This test is used to verify that the vulnerability was successfully triggered,
You can't have non-existent method calls in the results you give,
Just generate a single test method,
For fuzzy parameters, give specific commonly used types, such as Object,String and so on,
Only the function under test statement is wrapped by a try catch statement(Excluding assert statement), the Exception class uses an exception, and does nothing after the catch,
The code corresponds to the function being tested, with context information, for example: 

The source code of the function under test is (The unit test should test this function):
public static void unzipApacheCompress ( File archiveFile , File toDir ) throws IOException { ZipFile zipFile = null ; try { zipFile = new ZipFile ( archiveFile ) ; Enumeration < ZipArchiveEntry > zipEntries = zipFile . getEntriesInPhysicalOrder ( ) ; while ( zipEntries . hasMoreElements ( ) ) { ZipArchiveEntry entry = zipEntries . nextElement ( ) ; String entryName = entry . getName ( ) ; File outFile = new File ( toDir , entryName ) ; if ( ! outFile . getParentFile ( ) . exists ( ) ) { if ( ! outFile . getParentFile ( ) . mkdirs ( ) ) { } } if ( entry . isDirectory ( ) ) { if ( ! outFile . mkdir ( ) ) { } } else { InputStream zipStream = null ; OutputStream outFileStream = null ; zipStream = zipFile . getInputStream ( entry ) ; outFileStream = new FileOutputStream ( outFile ) ; try { IOUtils . copy ( zipStream , outFileStream ) ; } finally { IOUtils . closeQuietly ( zipStream ) ; IOUtils . closeQuietly ( outFileStream ) ; if ( ( entry . getUnixMode ( ) & EXEC_MASK ) != 0 ) { outFile . setExecutable ( true ) ; } } } } } finally { ZipFile . closeQuietly ( zipFile ) ; } } 

and the class name of the function under test is:
ZipUtility

The vulnerable third-party library function and the class to which the function belongs are:
class name:ZipFile
method name:ZipFile

The input1 variable name for this unit test is "input1", and the value of this "input1" is:
compress/CVE-2018-1324/demo/difflist_fsbwserver.f-secure.com_80_583109529_2.zip

The input2 variable name for this unit test is "input2", and the value of this "input2" is:
compress/CVE-2018-1324/demo/

After declaring test input data, you need to call the following statement:
MethodCallInterceptor.interceptor(
org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.zip.ZipFile.class,"ZipFile", new Object[]{input}
);

The assert statement to verify that the vulnerability was successfully triggered is fixed as:
assertTrue(MethodCallInterceptor.isTrigger);
