I want you to generate a unit test, using the JUnit testing framework, 
This test is used to verify that the vulnerability was successfully triggered,
You can't have non-existent method calls in the results you give,
Just generate a single test method,
For fuzzy parameters, give specific commonly used types, such as Object,String and so on,
Only the function under test statement is wrapped by a try catch statement(Excluding assert statement), the Exception class uses an exception, and does nothing after the catch,
The code corresponds to the function being tested, with context information, for example: 

The source code of the function under test is (The unit test should test this function):
public static void main ( String [ ] args ) throws IOException { String zipPath = "e:\\123.7z" ; String pwd = "79" ; boolean bool = validatePwd ( zipPath , pwd ) ; System . out . println ( bool ) ; } 

and the class name of the function under test is:
ZipPwdUtil

There is a method call chain from the function under test to the function called by the vulnerability code, the list of functions is:
main
validatePwd
Where there is a vulnerability code call function source code is (This function is used to help you understand):
public static boolean validatePwd ( String path7ZFile , String pwd ) { boolean bool = true ; File file = new File ( path7ZFile ) ; if ( ! file . exists ( ) ) { System . out . println ( "no file[" + path7ZFile + "]" ) ; return false ; } if ( null == pwd ) { pwd = "" ; } try { @ SuppressWarnings ( "resource" ) SevenZFile sevenZFile = new SevenZFile ( file , pwd . getBytes ( Charset . forName ( "UTF-16LE" ) ) ) ; SevenZArchiveEntry entry = null ; while ( null != ( entry = sevenZFile . getNextEntry ( ) ) ) { byte [ ] content = new byte [ 2 ] ; try { sevenZFile . read ( content , 0 , ( int ) entry . getSize ( ) ) ; } catch ( Exception e ) { return false ; } } } catch ( IOException e ) { return false ; } return bool ; } 

and the class name of this function is:
ZipPwdUtil

The vulnerable third-party library function and the class to which the function belongs are:
class name:SevenZFile
method name:SevenZFile

The input1 variable name for this unit test is "input1", and the value of this "input1" is:
compress/cve-2021-35516/7zBruteforce/endheadercorrupted.7z

The input2 variable name for this unit test is "input2", and the value of this "input2" is:
  10

After declaring test input data, you need to call the following statement:
MethodCallInterceptor.interceptor(
org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.zip.NioZipEncoding.class,"SevenZFile", new Object[]{input}
);

The assert statement to verify that the vulnerability was successfully triggered is fixed as:
assertTrue(MethodCallInterceptor.isTriggered());
assertTrue(MethodCallInterceptor.isConditionMet());
