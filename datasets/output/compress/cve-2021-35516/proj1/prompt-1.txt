I want you to generate a unit test, using the JUnit testing framework, 
This test is used to verify that the vulnerability was successfully triggered,
You can't have non-existent method calls in the results you give,
Just generate a single test method,
For fuzzy parameters, give specific commonly used types, such as Object,String and so on,
Only the function under test statement is wrapped by a try catch statement(Excluding assert statement), the Exception class uses an exception, and does nothing after the catch,
The code corresponds to the function being tested, with context information, for example: 

The source code of the function under test is (The unit test should test this function):
public static SevenZFile decompress ( File file , String password ) throws IOException { byte [ ] passwordBytes = password . getBytes ( Charsets . UTF_16LE ) ; return new SevenZFile ( file , passwordBytes ) ; } 

and the class name of the function under test is:
App

The vulnerable third-party library function and the class to which the function belongs are:
class name:SevenZFile
method name:SevenZFile

The input1 variable name for this unit test is "input1", and the value of this "input1" is:
pocdataset/compress/cve-2021-35516/7zBruteforce/endheadercorrupted.7z

The input2 variable name for this unit test is "input2", and the value of this "input2" is:
  10

After declaring test input data, you need to call the following statement:
MethodCallInterceptor.interceptor(
org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.zip.NioZipEncoding.class,"SevenZFile", new Object[]{input}
);

The assert statement to verify that the vulnerability was successfully triggered is fixed as:
assertTrue(MethodCallInterceptor.isTriggered());
assertTrue(MethodCallInterceptor.isConditionMet());
