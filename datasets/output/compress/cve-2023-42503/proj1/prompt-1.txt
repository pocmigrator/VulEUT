I want you to generate a unit test, using the JUnit testing framework,
This test is used to verify that the vulnerability was successfully triggered,
You can't have non-existent method calls in the results you give,
Just generate a single test method,
For fuzzy parameters, give specific commonly used types, such as Object,String and so on,
Only the function under test statement is wrapped by a try catch statement(Excluding assert statement), the Exception class uses an exception, and does nothing after the catch,
The code corresponds to the function being tested, with context information, for example: 

The source code of the function under test is (The unit test should test this function):
public static void extractTarArchive ( File file , String folder ) throws IOException { logger . info ( "Extracting archive {} into folder {}" , file . getName ( ) , folder ) ; try ( FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream ( file ) ; BufferedInputStream bis = new BufferedInputStream ( fis ) ; GzipCompressorInputStream gzip = new GzipCompressorInputStream ( bis ) ; TarArchiveInputStream tar = new TarArchiveInputStream ( gzip ) ) { TarArchiveEntry entry ; while ( ( entry = ( TarArchiveEntry ) tar . getNextEntry ( ) ) != null ) { extractEntry ( entry , tar , folder ) ; } } logger . info ( "Archive extracted" ) ; } 

and the class name of the function under test is:
Utils

The vulnerable third-party library function and the class to which the function belongs are:
class name:TarArchiveInputStream
method name:TarArchiveInputStream

The input1 variable name for this unit test is "input1", and the value of this "input1" is:
pocdataset/compress/CVE-2018-1324/demo/difflist_fsbwserver.f-secure.com_80_583109529_2.tar

After declaring test input data, you need to call the following statement:
MethodCallInterceptor.interceptor(
TarArchiveInputStream.class,"TarArchiveInputStream", new Object[]{input}
);

The assert statement to verify that the vulnerability was successfully triggered is fixed as:
assertTrue(MethodCallInterceptor.isTrigger);
