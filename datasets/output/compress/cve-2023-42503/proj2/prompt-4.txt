I want you to generate a unit test, using the JUnit testing framework, 
This test is used to verify that the vulnerability was successfully triggered,
You can't have non-existent method calls in the results you give,
Just generate a single test method,
For fuzzy parameters, give specific commonly used types, such as Object,String and so on,
Only the function under test statement is wrapped by a try catch statement(Excluding assert statement), the Exception class uses an exception, and does nothing after the catch,
The code corresponds to the function being tested, with context information, for example: 

The source code of the function under test is (The unit test should test this function):
public static boolean extract ( Context context , Uri source , File destination ) { if ( source == null ) return false ; try { return extract ( context . getContentResolver ( ) . openInputStream ( source ) , destination , null ) ; } catch ( FileNotFoundException e ) { return false ; } } 

and the class name of the function under test is:
TarZstdUtils

There is a method call chain from the function under test to the function called by the vulnerability code, the list of functions is:
extract
extract
Where there is a vulnerability code call function source code is (This function is used to help you understand):
private static boolean extract ( InputStream source , File destination , OnExtractFileListener onExtractFileListener ) { try ( InputStream inStream = new ZstdCompressorInputStream ( source ) ; ArchiveInputStream tar = new TarArchiveInputStream ( inStream ) ) { TarArchiveEntry entry ; while ( ( entry = ( TarArchiveEntry ) tar . getNextEntry ( ) ) != null ) { if ( ! tar . canReadEntryData ( entry ) ) continue ; File file = new File ( destination , entry . getName ( ) ) ; if ( onExtractFileListener != null ) { file = onExtractFileListener . onExtractFile ( destination , entry . getName ( ) ) ; if ( file == null ) continue ; } if ( entry . isDirectory ( ) ) { if ( ! file . isDirectory ( ) ) file . mkdirs ( ) ; } else { if ( entry . isSymbolicLink ( ) ) { FileUtils . symlink ( entry . getLinkName ( ) , file . getAbsolutePath ( ) ) ; } else { try ( BufferedOutputStream outStream = new BufferedOutputStream ( new FileOutputStream ( file ) , StreamUtils . BUFFER_SIZE ) ) { if ( ! StreamUtils . copy ( tar , outStream ) ) return false ; } } } FileUtils . chmod ( file , 0771 ) ; } return true ; } catch ( IOException e ) { return false ; } } 

and the class name of this function is:
TarZstdUtils

The vulnerable third-party library function and the class to which the function belongs are:
class name:TarArchiveInputStream
method name:TarArchiveInputStream

The input1 variable name for this unit test is "input1", and the value of this "input1" is:
compress/CVE-2018-1324/demo/difflist_fsbwserver.f-secure.com_80_583109529_2.tar

The input2 variable name for this unit test is "input2", and the value of this "input2" is:
 source/ 

The input3 variable name for this unit test is "input3", and the value of this "input3" is:
 target

After declaring test input data, you need to call the following statement:
MethodCallInterceptor.interceptor(
TarArchiveInputStream.class,"TarArchiveInputStream", new Object[]{input}
);

The assert statement to verify that the vulnerability was successfully triggered is fixed as:
assertTrue(MethodCallInterceptor.isTrigger);
