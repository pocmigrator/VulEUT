I want you to generate a unit test, using the JUnit testing framework,
This test is used to verify that the vulnerability was successfully triggered,
You can't have non-existent method calls in the results you give,
Just generate a single test method,
For fuzzy parameters, give specific commonly used types, such as Object,String and so on,
Only the function under test statement is wrapped by a try catch statement(Excluding assert statement), the Exception class uses an exception, and does nothing after the catch,
The code corresponds to the function being tested, with context information, for example:

The source code of the function under test is (The unit test should test this function):
public static String decrypt ( String encryptPassword , String salt ) throws Exception { return AesUtil . decrypt ( Md5Util . MD5 ( salt + CommonConst . ZYD_SECURITY_KEY ) , encryptPassword ) ; }

and the class name of the function under test is:
PasswordUtil

There is a method call chain from the function under test to the function called by the vulnerability code, the list of functions is:
decrypt
decrypt
Where there is a vulnerability code call function source code is (This function is used to help you understand):
public static String decrypt ( String passwd , String encrypted ) throws Exception { Cipher cipher = Cipher . getInstance ( DEFAULT_CIPHER_ALGORITHM ) ; cipher . init ( Cipher . DECRYPT_MODE , getSecretKey ( passwd ) ) ; byte [ ] result = cipher . doFinal ( Base64 . decodeBase64 ( encrypted ) ) ; return new String ( result , "utf-8" ) ; }

and the class name of this function is:
AesUtil

The vulnerable third-party library function and the class to which the function belongs are:
class name:Base64
method name:decodeBase64

The input variable name for this unit test is "input", and the value of this "input" is:
publishMessage

After declaring test input data, you need to call the following statement:
MethodCallInterceptor.interceptor(
org.apache.commons.codec.binary.Base64.class,"decodeBase64", new Object[]{input}
);

The assert statement to verify that the vulnerability was successfully triggered is fixed as:
assertTrue(MethodCallInterceptor.isTriggered);
assertTrue(MethodCallInterceptor.areConditionsMet);
