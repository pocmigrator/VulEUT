I want you to generate a unit test, using the JUnit testing framework, 
This test is used to verify that the vulnerability was successfully triggered,
You can't have non-existent method calls in the results you give,
Just generate a single test method,
For fuzzy parameters, give specific commonly used types, such as Object,String and so on,
Only the function under test statement is wrapped by a try catch statement(Excluding assert statement), the Exception class uses an exception, and does nothing after the catch,
The code corresponds to the function being tested, with context information, for example: 

The source code of the function under test is (The unit test should test this function):
public FileWriter ( String filename ) { _filename = normalize ( filename ) ; _writer = getWriter ( false ) ; } 

and the class name of the function under test is:
FileWriter

The vulnerable third-party library function and the class to which the function belongs are:
class name:FilenameUtils
method name:normalize

The input variable name for this unit test is "input", and the value of this "input" is:
\\\\..\\foo

After declaring test input data, you need to call the following statement:
MethodCallInterceptor.interceptor(
org.apache.commons.io.FilenameUtils.normalize.class,"normalize", new Object[]{input}
);

The assert statement to verify that the vulnerability was successfully triggered is fixed as:
assertTrue(MethodCallInterceptor.isTriggered);
assertTrue(MethodCallInterceptor.areConditionsMet);
