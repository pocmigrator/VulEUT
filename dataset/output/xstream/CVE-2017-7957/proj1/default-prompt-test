I want you to generate a unit test, using the JUnit testing framework,
This test is used to verify that the vulnerability was successfully triggered,
You can't have non-existent method calls in the results you give,
Just generate a single test method,
The code corresponds to the function being tested, with context information, for example:

The source code of the function under test is (The unit test should test this function):
public static < T > T xml2Obj ( String xml , Class < T > clazz ) { return xml2Obj ( xml , clazz , clazz . getSimpleName ( ) ) ; }

and the class name of the function under test is:
XmlUtil

The vulnerable third-party library function and the class to which the function belongs are:
class name:XStream
method name:fromXML

The variable name of input data is input, and the test input data for this unit test is:
<void>
